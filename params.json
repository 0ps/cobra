Diff Scan\r\n\r\nBy comparing with the online code or the previous submission to find out the change code, and then only the changes to scan the code.\r\n\r\n##### Advantages and disadvantages\r\nScanning speed, can immediately know the results of the scan. But the scanning range is small.\r\n\r\n##### Scene\r\nfor the daily release, we need to quickly know that this is the existence of the risk of the code, using the contrast scan will be able to know the results for the first time.\r\n\r\n#### 2. Full Scan\r\nBy playing the compression package or send Git/SVN address, decompression, download the project will be all the code for the full scan.\r\n\r\n##### Advantages and disadvantages\r\nThe scan speed is slow, but a comprehensive scan.\r\n##### Scene\r\nThe whole volume scan can be used for items that are not frequently published in history.\r\n\r\n### The development of language and support framework\r\nIn view of our current online projects mainly for PHP and JAVA, so we will support the two languages in a period.\r\nAnd do a good job of our current framework for compatibility, to ensure that we can cover most of the business online.\r\n\r\nDeveloper of Language|Framework\r\n--- | ---\r\nPHP|\tKohana、Laravel\r\nJAVA|\tSpring、Struts\r\n\r\n### Supported vulnerability types\r\nA major sweep some of the more common and difficult to put an end to the loopholes, the follow-up to support a number of dynamic scanning.\r\n\r\nItem | Remark\r\n--- | ---\r\nXSS\t|Cross-Site Scripting\r\nCSRF|\tCross-site request forgery\r\nSQL Injection|\tSQL Injection\r\nSensitive Data Exposure|Sensitive Info Exposure、Back File Exposure、Code Exposure、Server Info Exposure、SVN/GIT Exposure...\r\nWebShell\t|WebShell\r\nBackdoor | \r\ntorjor|\tBig torjor、Small torjor\r\nURL Redirector Abuse\t|\r\nMisconfiguration|\r\nLFI/RFI|\tLocal File Inclusion、Remote File Inclusion\r\nCommand Execution|\r\nCode Execution|\r\nHeader Injection|\r\n\r\n##### To be supported by the type of vulnerability (follow-up plan to gradually access)\r\nItem|Remark\r\n--- | ---\r\nVariable Coverage\t|\r\nCRLF Injection CRLF|\r\nUnauthorized Access|\r\nWeak Password\t|\r\nXML Injection\t|\r\nBrute Force\t|\r\n\r\n### Screenshot\r\n![Cobra](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wufeifei/cobra/master/doc/SCREENSHOT.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Links\r\n- Documents: https://github.com/wufeifei/cobra/wiki\r\n",
